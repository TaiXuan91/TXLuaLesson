os.date ([format [, time]])

Returns a string or a table containing date and time, formatted according to the given string format.

If the time argument is present, this is the time to be formatted (see the os.time function for a description of this value). Otherwise, date formats the current time.

If format is not "*t",
then date returns the date as a string, 
formatted according to the same rules as the ISO C function strftime.

When called without arguments, date returns a reasonable date and time representation 
that depends on the host system and on the current locale. (More specifically, os.date() 
is equivalent to os.date("%c").)

os.difftime (t2, t1)

Returns the difference, in seconds, from time t1 to time t2 (where the times are values returned by os.time). In POSIX, Windows, and some other systems, this value is exactly t2-t1.

os.time ([table])

Returns the current time when called without arguments, or a time representing the local date and time specified by the given table. This table must have fields year, month, and day, and may have fields hour (default is 12), min (default is 0), sec (default is 0), and isdst (default is nil). Other fields are ignored. For a description of these fields, see the os.date function.

The values in these fields do not need to be inside their valid ranges. For instance, if sec is -10, it means -10 seconds from the time specified by the other fields; if hour is 1000, it means +1000 hours from the time specified by the other fields.

The returned value is a number, whose meaning depends on your system. In POSIX, Windows, and some other systems, this number counts the number of seconds since some given start time (the "epoch"). In other systems, the meaning is not specified, and the number returned by time can be used only as an argument to os.date and os.difftime.
